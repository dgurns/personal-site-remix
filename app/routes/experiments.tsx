						James Gurney Knowledge Base ↗
					</a>{' '}
					<p className="text-gray-400">
						My dad is an artist who has written thousands of blog posts, made
						hundreds of YouTube videos, and written two instructional books.
						With the announcement of ChatGPT Plugins and the open sourcing of
						ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin, I realized I could create a knowledgebase
						with access to all of my dad's written materials, accessible via a
						chat interface. I forked the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin and customized
						the Python server with some data scraping scripts – with GPT-4's
						help, of course. Then I built a chat UI with NextJS, taking the
						opportunity to play around with React Server Components. In the
						future we might turn this into a ChatGPT plugin since the backend
						server can be used for that too.

						Craic AI ↗
					</a>{' '}
					<p className="text-gray-400">
						I thought it might be cool to use the ChatGPT API to help plan group
						events. The idea is that you could input an event name and rough
						date range, enter your invitees, and then they'd be automatically
						emailed about availability. Then the app would feed the responses
						into ChatGPT and have it pick a date that works for everyone. Not
						sure if I'll finish this one but the tech was fun: Remix, Cloudflare
						Pages, D1, ChatGPT API, and some prompt engineering.

						AI-rish Tunes ↗
					</a>{' '}
					<p className="text-gray-400">
						Each day, I pick a random Irish tune and ask an AI to generate an
						image for it. Made with Cloudflare Workers and using D1, their new
						distributed SQLite product, and R2, their global object storage. All
						running on the edge.

						Album Cover Generator ↗
					</a>{' '}
					<p className="text-gray-400">
						This app helps you get ideas for your next album cover. It uses AI
						to generate images from text via the DALL-E API. The API would be
						too expensive at scale so I've got it behind a username and password
						- "larry" and "murphy".

					<p className="text-gray-400">
						Trying out Cloudflare Workers KV, a globally distributed key-value
						store. This site already runs on the edge via Cloudflare Workers, so
						I wanted to experiment with putting data on the edge as well. It's
						super fast.

					<p className="text-gray-400">
						AI has been getting really good lately. This is a GPT-3 powered
						chatbot which uses the OpenAI API. If you're not familiar with
						Pintman, check out the original video after the jump.

						It was so much fun building the Pintman chatbot that I decided to
						open-source a template so you can make your own.
