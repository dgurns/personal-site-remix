					<p className="text-gray-400">
						We all put our medical symptoms into ChatGPT. But I believe that data is 
						yours and should never leave your computer. So I built Second Opinion. 
						Local LLM via Ollama, local SQLite database, local app. 100% private. I built this with
						Cursor and found Gemini 2.5 Pro to be the best model at the moment. It is surprisingly
						good at UI design – better than Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Grok 3, for this example
						at least.

						Edit Yourself ↗

					<p className="text-gray-400">
						This experiment became a tad dystopian. I was curious to see if one
						AI agent could update another agent's system prompt, creating a
						self-reinforcing feedback loop. Turns out it can, of course. The
						goal you choose will guide the AI's behavior. As you can see in this
						example, when you give it a goal like maximizing profit, it will do
						whatever it takes to achieve it. Needless to say this has
						potentially dark implications for society and I think engineers will
						need to be <em>extremely</em> cognizant of this when building AI
						systems. This was built with SvelteKit (very smooth experience), GPT
						3.5 Turbo, and deployed to Cloudflare Pages.{' '}

						is a cool example. Speak a Site is a proof of concept to see if you
						can control the web with your voice! It records audio via the web
						audio API, sends it to a Cloudflare Worker to be transcribed by
						Whisper, then uses Llama 2 to update the HTML based on your guidance
						and renders it on the page. This is a bit slow currently but it
						works! Plug in GPT4 Turbo - or whatever comes next - and this starts
						getting really interesting. Here's the{' '}

						Clix ↗
					</a>{' '}
					<p className="text-gray-400">
						I'm fascinated by the idea of allowing an LLM agent to take
						real-world actions. Clix is a first experiment in that direction.
						You can type in what you want to do – for example, "Rebase this
						branch on top of the latest master" – and Clix will query an LLM and
						suggest a command for you to run. If you agree, it will actually run
						the command on your computer. It seems to be capable of chaining
						multi-step commands together. Lots of ideas for where to take this
						next.

						I wanted to play around with <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>,{' '}
						<a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, and{' '}
						<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/">
							Cloudflare AI
						</a>
						, so I built this simple app. HTMX is intriguing to me because it is
						a return to simplicity on the client side. The React ecosystem is
						extremely powerful but has become heavy and over-complicated. HTMX
						lets the server drive application state. For example, if you submit
						a form, it makes a POST request to the server, which returns just
						the HTML snippet for the updated UI, which HTMX then swaps in on the
						browser. Astro works well with this pattern because you can return
						partials from server endpoints. Takeaways: If I was building a
						website with mostly static content and a few forms, I would
						definitely consider Astro and HTMX. For a more interactive web app,
						for example something with various UI elements appearing/hiding
						based on user actions, or complicated loading states, I'd probably
						use Remix.

						James Gurney Knowledge Base ↗

					<p className="text-gray-400">
						My dad is an artist who has written thousands of blog posts, made
						hundreds of YouTube videos, and written two instructional books.
						With the announcement of ChatGPT Plugins and the open sourcing of
						ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin, I realized I could create a knowledgebase
						with access to all of my dad's written materials, accessible via a
						chat interface. I forked the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin and customized
						the Python server with some data scraping scripts – with GPT-4's
						help, of course. Then I built a chat UI with NextJS, taking the
						opportunity to play around with React Server Components. In the
						future we might turn this into a ChatGPT plugin since the backend
						server can be used for that too.

						Craic AI ↗
					</a>{' '}
					<p className="text-gray-400">
						I thought it might be cool to use the ChatGPT API to help plan group
						events. The idea is that you could input an event name and rough
						date range, enter your invitees, and then they'd be automatically
						emailed about availability. Then the app would feed the responses
						into ChatGPT and have it pick a date that works for everyone. Not
						sure if I'll finish this one but the tech was fun: Remix, Cloudflare
						Pages, D1, ChatGPT API, and some prompt engineering.

						Each day, I pick a random Irish tune and ask an AI to generate an

						This app helps you get ideas for your next album cover. It uses AI
