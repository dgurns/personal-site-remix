If you read my previous post about [Remix](https://remix.run), you know that I'm excited about it. As much as I love NextJS, Remix introduces a new paradigm that combines the best parts of server- and client-side rendering while removing complexity.

JavaScript fatigue aside, I did have a complexity problem with my side project [Trad Archive](https://www.tradarchive.com). 

I had chosen a stack which enabled serverless infrastructure, granular data access, client-side caching, and full preview deploys:
- NextJS
- Apollo Client
- Apollo Server
- TypeGraphQL
- TypeORM
- Serverless Framework  

Deployed via CI/CD on every git push:
- Vercel (client)
- AWS Lambda (server)
- Planetscale (DB) 
 
The benefits of that stack are nice, but it has a _lot_ of dependencies. If Trad Archive is going to be a sustainable open source project, other devs need to easily understand the code and make changes. This stack had too many edge cases and quirks. 

This illustrates the gist of what was happening (h/t to [Theo](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg)):

I realized I needed to simplify.

I wanted to keep the benefits of the old stack -- especially the full preview deploys -- but needed to remove boilerplate, reduce the number of interfaces, and streamline deployment.

Remix turned out to be a great solution.

The new stack is:
- Remix
- Prisma

Deployed via CI/CD to:
- Vercel 
- Planetscale

The basic summary is that instead of having a client app which consumes data from a separate backend API, the client and backend get colocated into the same Remix app. 

I recommend reading through the Remix [homepage](https://remix.run) to get a better sense of how it works.

Basically, when a request comes into your Remix app, you can define a [loader](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#loader) which runs on the server, fetches data, and returns static HTML to the client. 

The `loader` essentially is the API. But you don't have to define a GraphQL schema, or endpoints, or anything like that. You can just query the DB directly and return data for your component. 

```js
export async function loader() {  
	const items = await db.item.findMany();
	return json(items);
}

export default function MyComponent() {
	const items = useLoaderData();
	return (
		<div>
			{items.map(i => <p>{i.name}</p>)}
		</div>
	)
}
```

This removes a huge amount of boilerplate code. No more `if (data.loading) { return <Loading /> }`. No more defining GraphQL fragments in your React app. No more normalized data caching via Apollo Client -- which, incidentally, I recommend avoiding at all costs.

After I migrated to Remix, overall app code decreased from about 30k to 20k lines. 

And things were a lot simpler to reason about. If you can understand Remix and Prisma, that's all you really need to know. 

There's a single deployment via Vercel, instead of simultaneous deployments to Vercel and Lambda. That makes production and preview deploys simpler, as well as rollbacks.

I also took the opportunity to remove features that weren't being actively used.

Deleting code is one of my favorite things in software engineering. It usually means you have learned something and found a better way to do it. 

Now [Trad Archive](https://github.com/dgurns/trad-archive) is easier to develop on, faster for users, and should be on the path to a more sustainable future.
