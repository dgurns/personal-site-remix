There is a big upcoming collection of Irish music from New York City. It's being
organized by the [Irish Traditional Music Archive](https://itma.ie) in Dublin
and covers NY-based musicians over the last century. I'm very excited to see
what they've pulled together in collaboration with NY legends like Don Meade. 

ITMA invited me to say a few words for a promo video. Here it is!

This was filmed and edited by Iarfhlaith Ã“ Domhnaill along with Alan Woods and
Adam Girard. I'm amazed at the kind of videos that a small, talented team can
make these days. It feels like a completely different world than even ten years
ago.

Thanks also to my dad [James Gurney](https://jamesgurney.com) and [The
Yanks](https://yanksband.com) for the sketches and footage used in the video.
