					<div>
						Over the past few years, I've rearchitected legacy React, Go, and
						Python apps, built a REST API with role-based access control, added
						event tracking, introduced TypeScript, set up scalable dev processes
						with automated CI/CD, mentored engineers, and worked on new product
						development, among many other things. Some tools I've used are
						React, NextJS, TypeScript, Playwright, Go, Python, gRPC, Docker, AWS
						Lambda, BigQuery, Kubernetes, Vercel, and GitHub Actions.

						This is a really fun open source project I've been building in
						partnership with the Irish Traditional Music Archive in Dublin. The
						goal is to make their collections accessible to the public and use
						crowdsourcing to tag previously unheard recordings. Technologies
						used include Remix, Tailwind, Prisma, PlanetScale, and Vercel.
