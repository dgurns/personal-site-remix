A word that will be on its way out in 2026: "Alignment"

This sums it up nicely, from a principal eng at Google:

"I'm not joking and this isn't funny. We have been trying to build distributed agent orchestrators at Google since last year. There are various options, not everyone is aligned... I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour."

In an age when individuals already have multiple times more leverage than before, and may soon have 10-100x... alignment is too costly.

Too much work can happen in the time it takes to make decisions by consensus, where anyone can have a veto.

This already slowed down organizations -- now multiply that. 

Instead, what's important?
- Clear vision
- Lightweight processes
- Clear decision makers with full autonomy

Of course, shared context is a good thing. Being on the same page is good. Feeling like part of the same team. Sharing wins. 

But in a time when individuals can move faster than ever before, nothing slows down a company more than "alignment".
